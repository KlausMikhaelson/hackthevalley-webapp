# How We Built It

We built a full-stack financial wellness platform with a Next.js 15 frontend, MongoDB database, and AI-powered roasting via Google Gemini. The system features a robust **CI/CD pipeline** with **SonarQube** for continuous code quality analysis, automated testing workflows, and GitHub Actions for deployment. Our browser extension intercepts purchases in real-time, checks spending against user goals, and uses AI to roast overspendersâ€”encouraging them to save instead. When users click "I'll Save," the money is automatically distributed across their savings goals and tracked for analytics. The entire codebase maintains high quality standards through automated **SonarQube scans** that analyze code coverage, detect bugs, and enforce security best practices before every deployment.
