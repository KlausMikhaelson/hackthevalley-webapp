# Goals Dashboard Integration - Complete ✅

## What Was Done

The Goals component has been fully integrated with the backend API to create, manage, and track savings goals.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Automatic API Integration**
- The Goals component now automatically fetches goals from the database
- Uses the `useGoals` hook for all API operations
- Falls back to prop-based behavior if props are provided (backward compatible)

### 2. **Create Savings Goals**
- Click the "+" button to open the create goal dialog
- Enter goal name (e.g., "Emergency Fund", "Vacation", "New Car")
- Set target amount
- Goals are automatically saved to MongoDB via `/api/goals/create`
- Type is set to `'savings'` with period `'one_time'`

### 3. **Add Money to Goals**
- Each goal has an input field to add money
- Click the "+" button to add the amount
- Updates the goal's `current_amount` via `/api/goals/update`
- Progress bar updates automatically

### 4. **Set Default Goal**
- Click the star icon to set a goal as default/primary
- Only one goal can be default at a time
- Default goal appears on the main dashboard

### 5. **Real-time Updates**
- All changes are immediately saved to the database
- Goals list refreshes after any operation
- Loading states while fetching data

## API Endpoints Used

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/api/goals/list` | GET | Fetch all user goals |
| `/api/goals/create` | POST | Create new savings goal |
| `/api/goals/update` | PUT | Update goal (add money, set default) |

## How to Use

### Creating a Goal
1. Go to the "Goals" tab in the dashboard
2. Click the "+" button in the top right
3. Enter goal details:
   - **Name**: What you're saving for
   - **Target Amount**: How much you want to save
4. Click "Create Goal"

### Adding Money to a Goal
1. Find the goal in the list
2. Enter an amount in the input field
3. Click the "+" button next to the input
4. The progress bar updates automatically

### Setting a Primary Goal
1. Click the star icon (⭐) next to any goal
2. That goal becomes your primary/default goal
3. It will appear on the main dashboard

## Database Schema

Goals are stored with the following structure:

```typescript
{
  user_id: string;           // Clerk user ID
  name: string;              // "Emergency Fund"
  type: 'savings';           // Always 'savings' for these goals
  target_amount: number;     // 5000
  current_amount: number;    // 1200 (how much saved so far)
  period: 'one_time';        // One-time savings goal
  is_default: boolean;       // Is this the primary goal?
}
```

## Goal Types

The system supports three types of goals:

1. **daily_spending** - Daily spending limits (like the default $100/day)
2. **savings** - Savings goals (what you see in the Goals dashboard)
3. **custom** - Custom goals for future features

## Integration with Dashboard

The Goals component works in two modes:

### 1. Standalone Mode (API-backed)
```tsx
<Goals />
```
- Automatically fetches goals from API
- Uses Clerk user authentication
- All operations hit the database

### 2. Prop-based Mode (Legacy)
```tsx
<Goals 
  goals={localGoals}
  onAddToGoal={handleAddToGoal}
  onCreateGoal={handleCreateGoal}
  onSetDefaultGoal={handleSetDefaultGoal}
/>
```
- Uses provided props instead of API
- For backward compatibility or custom behavior

## Testing

To test the integration:

1. **Create a goal:**
   ```javascript
   // In browser console
   fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/goals/create', {
     method: 'POST',
     headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
     body: JSON.stringify({
       user_id: 'user_33e9j0LNB0oQPioPYS5tSvnwFT2',
       name: 'Vacation Fund',
       type: 'savings',
       target_amount: 3000,
       period: 'one_time'
     })
   }).then(r => r.json()).then(console.log);
   ```

2. **View goals:**
   ```javascript
   fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/goals/list?user_id=user_33e9j0LNB0oQPioPYS5tSvnwFT2')
     .then(r => r.json())
     .then(console.log);
   ```

3. **Add money to a goal:**
   - Use the UI in the Goals tab
   - Or call the API directly with the goal ID

## Next Steps

Potential enhancements:

- [ ] Delete goals functionality
- [ ] Edit goal name/target
- [ ] Goal categories/tags
- [ ] Goal deadlines with countdown
- [ ] Automatic savings rules
- [ ] Goal completion celebrations
- [ ] Share goals with family/friends
- [ ] Goal templates (common savings goals)

## Troubleshooting

### Goals not showing up?
- Check that you're logged in with Clerk
- Verify user has goals in database
- Check browser console for errors

### Can't create goals?
- Ensure MongoDB is connected
- Check that user_id is valid
- Verify API endpoints are accessible

### Updates not saving?
- Check network tab for failed requests
- Verify goal IDs are correct
- Ensure user has permission to update goals
